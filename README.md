# Who handles chargebacks, KYC/AML and customer service?
Chargebacks

As  our customer, you never have to deal with any attempted fraud by end-users. All chargebacks and other fraud attempts will be dealt with  by the fiat gateways aggregated in Exohood.

KYC/AML

KYC/AML procedures are implemented by the fiat gateways aggregated within Exohood. To buy cryptocurrencies, users will have to prove their identity to the fiat gateway used for a transaction. The fiat gateway is responsible for implementing appropriate procedures and compliance requirements to allow users to buy cryptocurrencies. Through Exohood, users can quickly fill in/upload all info and documents required by the fiat on-ramp. We never store this data ourselves.

# Learn More

Customer Service  

We ensure your customer service won’t be bothered with questions for fiat gateways. In case users need help, they can easily get answers to their questions. If Exohood’s FAQ doesn’t suffice, we ensure users they can easily reach the support department of the fiat gateway used for a transaction. Some fiat gateways also provide a dashboard so the user can track their own transaction. Upon completing a transaction, an email is sent to the user with more info on how to reach support as well.

# Do users have to go through KYC every time they transact?
No. We do not sell cryptocurrencies, nor do we exchange or convert between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. We provide our clients with software to provide a fiat on-ramp to their users. The software can be used by end-users to buy cryptocurrency from third-party fiat-to-crypto gateways.

# Do you have access to my funds?
No, we don’t. Your money passes through our partners’ websites. Our service has no access to your money.
